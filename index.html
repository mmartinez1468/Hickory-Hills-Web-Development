          which improve user experience and boost search engine rankings.
          By tailoring every detail, from the layout to the functionality, 
          we create websites that truly stand out and reflect your brand's 
          uniqueness. Our process also enables seamless integration of

        I'm currently studying in Spain, diving deeper into the 
        world of technology. When I'm not coding, you'll probably 
        find me watching or playing fútbol—it's my second love after 
        programming. I'm always eager to learn, build, and collaborate 
        on exciting web projects. Let’s create something awesome together!

        I specialize in crafting responsive and user-friendly websites, 
        blending clean code with modern design principles. Whether it's 
        front-end development, back-end logic, or full-stack solutions, 
        I enjoy tackling challenges and bringing ideas to life. I'm always 
        exploring new technologies and frameworks to stay ahead in the ever-evolving 
        world of web development. If you're looking for a passionate developer to collaborate 
        with, let's connect!

        Beyond coding and fútbol, I’m a firm believer in continuous learning and problem-solving. 
        I love diving into new challenges, whether it’s debugging complex code, optimizing performance, 
        or experimenting with the latest web technologies. My goal is to create seamless digital experiences 
        that are both visually appealing and highly functional. Every project I work on is an opportunity to 
        grow and push the boundaries of what’s possible on the web.

            Why not use a website builder
            <i class="arrow down"></i>
          </button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>Website builders can be a quick and easy solution for creating a website, 
              but they come with limitations. They often provide less flexibility in design
               and functionality compared to custom development. Performance, SEO optimization, 
               and scalability can also be restricted. Additionally, website builders may have 
               hidden costs, lack full ownership of your site’s code, and make it harder to migrate 
               in the future. If you want a unique, high-performing, and scalable website tailored 
               to your needs, custom development is the better choice.

            What is SEO and why is it so important?
            <i class="arrow down"></i>

          <div class="panel">
            <p>SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is the process of improving a website’s visibility 
              in search engines like Google. It involves optimizing content, structure, and performance 
              to rank higher in search results, making it easier for users to find your site. 
              SEO is crucial because higher rankings lead to more traffic, better credibility, 
              and increased conversions. A well-optimized website loads faster, provides a better 
              user experience, and attracts the right audience. Without SEO, your website may get 
              lost among millions of others, limiting its reach and potential growth.</p>

              A good website is essential because it serves as the digital face of your brand or business. 
              It creates the first impression for visitors, builds credibility, and helps attract and retain customers. 
              A well-designed website ensures a smooth user experience, fast loading times, and mobile responsiveness, 
              all of which improve engagement and conversion rates. Additionally, a good website enhances your online presence, 
              supports SEO efforts, and allows you to showcase your products, services, or content effectively. In today’s digital world, 
              a strong website is a key factor in staying competitive and reaching a wider audience.

              The time required to create a website depends on its complexity, features, and design requirements.
              Simple websites (e.g., basic landing pages or portfolios) can take a few days to a couple of weeks.
              Small business websites with multiple pages and some custom features may take 2–6 weeks.
              E-commerce sites or more complex websites with custom functionality can take 2–3 months or more.
              Fully custom web applications with advanced features may require several months of development.
              Factors like revisions, content creation, and integrations with third-party tools can also impact the timeline. 
              Proper planning and clear requirements help speed up the process.

            What's cheaper custom or a website builder?
            <i class="arrow down"></i>

          <div class="panel">
            <p>
              A website builder is generally cheaper upfront because it offers pre-made templates and drag-and-drop features. 
              Prices typically range from $10 to $50 per month, but costs can add up with premium features, plugins, and higher-tier 
              plans. A custom-built website requires a higher initial investment, often ranging from a few hundred to several thousand 
              dollars, depending on complexity. However, it provides full ownership, scalability, and better long-term value without 
              being locked into monthly fees or limited features.
